            <p><b><i>T20 World Cup: Rohit Sharma's captaincy against Pakistan was all class, says Uthappa</i></b></p><br>
            <p>India vs Pakistan, T20 World Cup 2024: Former India batter Robin Uthappa heaped praise on Rohit Sharma's captaincy, saying the skipper trusted his bowlers to get the job done in their successful defence of 119.</p><br>
            <p><b>In Short

                *Pakistan are on the verge of an early exit from the tournament</b></p> <br>
                <p>Rohit Sharma was all class with his role as captain and he trusted every bowler to do their job in India's win over Pakistan in a low-scoring T20 World Cup 2024 match on Sunday in New York, according to former India batter Robin Uthappa. India successfully defended 119, the lowest total they have managed to defend, to hand Pakistan a stinging blow. Bowlers saved the day for India after their star batters failed to get going on a ticky pitch at the Nassau County Cricket Stadium in New York.</p>

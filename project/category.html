                    <h3><a href="article.html?id=7">AI Technology</a></h3>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically only a human could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems. 

                        Today, the term “AI” describes a wide range of technologies that power many of the services and goods we use every day – from apps that recommend tv shows to chatbots that provide customer support in real time. But do all of these really constitute artificial intelligence as most of us envision it? And if not, then why do we use the term so often? 
                        
                        In this article, you’ll learn more about artificial intelligence, what it actually does, and different types of it. In the end, you’ll also learn about some of its benefits and dangers and explore flexible courses that can help you expand your knowledge of AI even further.</p> <br>
                        <p>Artificial intelligence examples 
                            Though the humanoid robots often associated with AI (think Star Trek: The Next Generation’s Data or Terminator’s  T-800) don’t exist yet, you’ve likely interacted with machine learning-powered services or devices many times before. 
                            
                            At the simplest level, machine learning uses algorithms trained on data sets to create machine learning models that allow computer systems to perform tasks like making song recommendations, identifying the fastest way to travel to a destination, or translating text from one language to another. Some of the most common examples of AI in use today include: 
                            
                            ChatGPT: Uses large language models (LLMs) to generate text in response to questions or comments posed to it. 
                            
                            Google Translate: Uses deep learning algorithms to translate text from one language to another. 
                            
                            Netflix: Uses machine learning algorithms to create personalized recommendation engines for users based on their previous viewing history. 
                            
                            Tesla: Uses computer vision to power self-driving features on their cars. </p>
